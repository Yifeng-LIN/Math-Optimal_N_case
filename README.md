# Math-Tool
What the code is for ?
The code provides several mathematic functions, allowing be used as code component for various situations.


How to run the code ?
Download and import the class in your Python code, and then you can use the interested functions.

Functions :
A) Optimal_N_case
For a serie of values (for exemple a serie of objects, each of them has a corrsponding value).
This algorithm allows to convert the values into a N cases values, for each of the values in the serie.
- The N cases values will be bigger than the previous value;
- The sum of all the converted N cases values should be the minimum possible. 

B) Detect_in_out
Detect if a point is inside or outside a N dimension contour, then provide result tag for the point.
The use cases could be variable:
- This algorithm can be used to detect whether GPS location is inside a set area;
- In an anormaly detection process, this algorithm could be used to check if the statue is anormal.
